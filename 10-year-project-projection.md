# 10-Year Yacht Building and Learning Plan

## Year 1-2: Foundations and Learning
- Begin by studying the fundamentals of yacht design and naval architecture.
- Focus on principles of stability, hydrodynamics, materials, and construction techniques.
- Take online courses, attend workshops, and read textbooks to build a strong theoretical foundation.
- Collaborate with mentors or experts to gain insights and guidance.

## Year 3-4: Practical Experience
- Start with smaller boat building projects to gain hands-on experience with different materials and techniques.
- Experiment with model boats or smaller vessels to apply what you've learned and refine your skills.

## Year 5-6: Intermediate Projects
- Move on to more complex projects that require a deeper understanding of structural integrity and system integration.
- Consider collaborating with others who have complementary skills, such as marine engineers and electricians.

## Year 7-8: Advanced Concepts
- Dive into more advanced topics, such as integrating propulsion systems, onboard systems (electrical, plumbing, etc.), and automation.
- Undertake projects that push the boundaries of your knowledge and skills.

## Year 9-10: Culmination and Mastery
- By now, you should have a strong foundation in yacht design and construction.
- Consider taking on your 80ft yacht project, collaborating with a team of skilled professionals.
- Apply your knowledge of DevOps to streamline project management and collaboration processes.
- As you build the yacht, document each step meticulously, integrating both your DevOps expertise and yacht design skills.

Throughout the 10-year journey, make sure to keep a detailed record of your progress, challenges, and successes. This documentation will not only serve as a valuable resource for your own learning but could also contribute to your vision of merging DevOps practices with yacht design.
