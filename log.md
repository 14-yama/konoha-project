# Project Log - December 17, 2023

## Design and Prototype Stage

### Project elapsed time: 1116 hours 

#### Boat Construction Methods
I have dedicated time to understanding various boat construction methods. Explored both traditional and modern techniques.

#### Software Learning
##### CAD Software
- AutoCAD
- Inventor
- Fusion 360

##### Naval Architecture Software
- Maxsurf
- Blender

##### Web Development
- React
- Figma

### Progress Overview

1. **Boat Construction Knowledge**
   - Gained insights into the pros and cons of sailboats vs. motorboats.

2. **Software Challenges**
   - Explored multiple CAD and naval architecture tools.
   - Struggled with complex shapes but found Blender as a powerful solution.
   - Discovered the industry preference for Rhino but opted for Blender due to its open-source nature and extensive learning resources.

3. **Future Project Visualization**
   - Aim to animate the vessel's construction process similar to [example video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLeAtIMeoWY).

4. **Documentation Approach**
   - Planning to document the entire building process in an open-source web format.

5. **Web Application Development**
   - Using React, Figma, WebGL, and Three.js to create a parametric hydrostatic and stability app.
   - Users can create accounts to run different simulations.

6. **Project Naming**
   - Yacht Design and Construction Project: Fourteen Yama.
   - Design Stage: Konoha Project.

7. **Community Engagement**
   - Promoting an open-source philosophy.
   - Encouraging financial and labor contributions from interested individuals.

### Next Steps

- Continue refining boat design using Blender.
- Start building the React-driven web app for hydrostatic and stability simulations.
- Explore further contributions from the open-source community.
- Regularly update and maintain project documentation.

### Personal Reflection

I am pleased with the progress made so far. Learning Blender has been a game-changer, and the decision to embrace open-source tools aligns with my vision of community collaboration. The upcoming phases excite me, especially the development of the simulation app and the potential for broader project engagement. The journey is challenging but deeply fulfilling, reinforcing my commitment to the ocean exploration dream.
